# Somerville City Council Flowchart

This is (an attempt at) a flowchart showing selected procedural state changes for work items in the [Somerville, MA City Council](https://www.somervillema.gov/departments/city-council).

## Caveats

Note there are many simplifications here!

This is also a first attempt to capture how things work. It's not meant to be comprehensive.

That said, if you see errors or have suggestions, please let me know! Contact info is below.

## To edit

If you want to play with this and alter it to your liking, try going to: https://www.mermaidchart.com and pasting in the content of this project's flowchart.mmd file.

If you come up with something you like, please send it to me, or fork this repository and
submit a pull request!

## Please note

This is a self-acknowledged City Council-centric view of things! This is NOT supposed
to represent an over summary of decision-making. It's purely to help orient people
to the procedures in and surrounding the City Council.
